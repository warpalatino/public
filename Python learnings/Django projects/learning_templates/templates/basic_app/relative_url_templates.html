    <p>
      This page serves as an example of how to use relative urls with templates!
      (This is the relative_url_templates.html file.)
    </p>

    <!-- the characters below {# #} are used as comments in templates for debugging purposes -->
    <!-- {# Here are the examples:#}
    {# Must set the app_name=basic_app variable inside the basic_app/urls.py#} -->
    
    <!-- relative urls injected  -->
    <!-- basic_app below is matching with the app_name in the app urls.py to show a specific app view  -->
    <!-- admin below is defined as 'admin:index', valid at project level -->
    <!-- simple 'index' as third example is the home view, valid at project level -->

    <a href="{% url 'admin:index' %}">Admin</a>
    <a href="{% url 'basic_app:other' %}">other.html</a>
    <a href="{% url 'index' %}"> Homepage </a>
